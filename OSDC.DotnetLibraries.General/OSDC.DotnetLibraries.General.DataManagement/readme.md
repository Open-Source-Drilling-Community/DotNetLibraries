This package is developed as part of the Society of Petroleum (SPE) Open Source Drilling Community, a sub-committee of the Drilling System Automation Technical Section.

################
// DEPRECATED //
################

This package was originally intended to host the MetaInfo class which can be used as a pointer to data
- MetaInfo is now officially hosted in the repository dedicated to expose a shared data model for drilling and well data management
- https://github.com/Open-Source-Drilling-Community/DrillingContextualData

Consequently
- this package is deprecated
- and if you are willing to use DrillingContextualData shared data model, using the MetaInfo class defined in this package would conflict with the MetaInfo class defined in DrillingContextualData
