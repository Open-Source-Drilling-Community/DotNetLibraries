## General description
It contains the following standard libraries implemented in .NET, relevant for the development of scientific applications:
- [APIProxy](https://github.com/Open-Source-Drilling-Community/DotNetLibraries/tree/main/OSDC.DotnetLibraries.General/OSDC.DotnetLibraries.General.APIProxy): generic http client features to handle REST API requests and responses
- [Common](https://github.com/Open-Source-Drilling-Community/DotNetLibraries/tree/main/OSDC.DotnetLibraries.General/OSDC.DotnetLibraries.General.Common): general purpose classes/interfaces to handle data and variables
- [DataManagement](https://github.com/Open-Source-Drilling-Community/DotNetLibraries/tree/main/OSDC.DotnetLibraries.General/OSDC.DotnetLibraries.General.DataManagement): utility classes to identify data
- [JsonSD](https://github.com/Open-Source-Drilling-Community/DotNetLibraries/tree/main/OSDC.DotnetLibraries.General/OSDC.DotnetLibraries.General.JsonSD): serialization program used to expose data in json format typically used for REST API payload
- [Math (unit tests)](https://github.com/Open-Source-Drilling-Community/DotNetLibraries/tree/main/OSDC.DotnetLibraries.General/OSDC.DotnetLibraries.General.Math.UnitTest): unit tests associated with the Math library
- [Math](https://github.com/Open-Source-Drilling-Community/DotNetLibraries/tree/main/OSDC.DotnetLibraries.General/OSDC.DotnetLibraries.General.Math): linear algebra utility classes and functions
- [Statistics](https://github.com/Open-Source-Drilling-Community/DotNetLibraries/tree/main/OSDC.DotnetLibraries.General/OSDC.DotnetLibraries.General.Statistics): general purpose statistical classes and functions
- [DrillingProperties](https://github.com/Open-Source-Drilling-Community/DotNetLibraries/tree/main/OSDC.DotnetLibraries.General/OSDC.DotnetLibraries.Drilling.DrillingProperties): utility classes designed to handle uncertainty associated with scientific data
- [DrillingProperties (unit tests)](https://github.com/Open-Source-Drilling-Community/DotNetLibraries/tree/main/OSDC.DotnetLibraries.General/OSDC.DotnetLibraries.Drilling.DrillingProperties.UnitTest): unit tests associated with the `DrillingProperty` library
- [DrillingProperties (Example 1)](https://github.com/Open-Source-Drilling-Community/DotNetLibraries/tree/main/OSDC.DotnetLibraries.General/OSDC.DotnetLibraries.Drilling.DrillingProperties.Example01): An example of the primary use of `DrillingProperty` to describe uncertainty at the level of the properties of a class.
- [DrillingProperties (Example 2)](https://github.com/Open-Source-Drilling-Community/DotNetLibraries/tree/main/OSDC.DotnetLibraries.General/OSDC.DotnetLibraries.Drilling.DrillingProperties.Example02): An example of use of `DrillingProperty` with a focus on the declation of meta data assocated with drilling properties using `Attribute`.
- [DrillingProperties (Example 3)](https://github.com/Open-Source-Drilling-Community/DotNetLibraries/tree/main/OSDC.DotnetLibraries.General/OSDC.DotnetLibraries.Drilling.DrillingProperties.Example03): An example of use of `DrillingProperty` with a focus on the generation of the dictionary of descriptions of meta data associated with the drilling properies defined in an assembly.
- [Surveying (unit tests)](https://github.com/Open-Source-Drilling-Community/DotNetLibraries/tree/main/OSDC.DotnetLibraries.General/OSDC.DotnetLibraries.Drilling.Surveying.UnitTest): unit tests associated with the Surveying library
- [Surveying](https://github.com/Open-Source-Drilling-Community/DotNetLibraries/tree/main/OSDC.DotnetLibraries.General/OSDC.DotnetLibraries.Drilling.Surveying): utility classes and functions used in wellbore surveying

## Deployment
Most of these libraries have been packaged as .NET NuGets and published to [nuget.org](https://www.nuget.org/packages?q=OSDC.Dotnetlibraries).
